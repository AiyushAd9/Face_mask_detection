# 😷 Face Mask Detection using Deep Learning & OpenCV

A real-time face mask detection system built with **Python**, **Keras**, **OpenCV**, and **Streamlit**. This project detects whether a person is wearing a mask or not using a trained deep learning model.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Real-time face detection with webcam
- ✅ Mask vs No-Mask classification using a CNN model
- ✅ Clean and interactive **Streamlit UI**
- ✅ Trained on a balanced dataset of masked and unmasked faces
- ✅ Easy to run on your local machine
